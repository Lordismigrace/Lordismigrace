- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lordismigrace
- 👀 I’m interested in creating music that inspires the soul, as a singer, songwriter.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use the various interface tools available for creation of original music. This is a brand new chapter for me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on songwriting, recording, etc. with like minded artists to create music that resonates with the soul.
- 📫 How to reach me LordisMiGrace@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Any 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have been songwriting and singing for years but never shared my work until now. I am finally taking a leap of faith to explore and share my passions for song writing and singing. However, I have NO experience in this field and looking for other like minded artists to share and collaborate with.
